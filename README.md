# Gravity Simulation V2
**!! Take a look at my original project [here](https://github.com/balintjanik/gravity_simulation) for visuals !!**

A particle system simulating gravitational forces made with C++ and SFML. Earlier, I had a Processing project simulating gravitational forces, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/balintjanik/gravity_simulation). Even though that project was fine, I decided to make the same simulation with C++ and SFML. In this project I am planning to make a much more accurate and computationally less effective simulation. Both the calculation of gravitational forces and the collisions are going to be optimized with spatial partitioning (grid).

Currently the program calculates the gravitational forces affecting the particles and collisions (avoid overlap and conservation of momentum) and updates the display based on it. Calculation optimizations are not yet implemented. A relatively weak additional attracting force is planned to be implemented for close particles, to support planet formation.

## Use
More on how to run this program will be shared soon.

## Samples
Some snapshots will be uploaded once the project is done.
